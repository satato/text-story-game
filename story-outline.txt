Lore:
-----
  In a village named "Cnetha" [k-nee-thuh], there has long been one sovereign: King Sporbald. For years, King Sporbald had little 
trouble maintaining the people's joy and contentedness. There were few issues in regard to resources, as the forest directly to the 
South was plentiful with all sorts of delicious vegetation.
  The (much larger) Kingdom to the North, Marigald, was farther away, and harder to get to. While it was a two day's journey to the front
of the Southern forest, it was a five day's journey to Marigald, and a dangerous one at that. As there had been little communication
between Cnetha and Marigald for decades, the path there hadn't been repaved in years. It was crumbling, cracked, and broken in spots, and
some parts were missing chunks altogether. It is widely believed that the ancient Goblins of Discord lived nearby. And if they saw you,
you journey from then on out would be as chaotic as could ever be. There is, however, rumors of an invisibility potion being sold at the
Great Witch's house to the East. If one were to get their hands on this potion, they could safely travel the path to Marigald without
a care. If not, though, there is still a chance to defeat the goblins...though much harder.
